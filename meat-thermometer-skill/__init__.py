# They might be built-in to Python, from mycroft-core or from external
# libraries.  If you use an external library, be sure to include it
# in the requirements.txt file so the library is installed properly

# from the MycroftSkill class.  You extend this class as shown below.

    # The "stop" method defines what Mycroft does when told to stop during
    # the skill's execution. In this case, since the skill's functionality
    # is extremely simple, there is no need to override it.  If you DO
    # need to implement stop, you should return True to indicate you handled
    # it.

# The "create_skill()" method is used to create an instance of the skill.
# Note that it's outside the class itself.
